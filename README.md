# Sleep Disorder Prediction using KNN

This project uses machine learning to predict sleep disorders based on health and lifestyle data. The model employs the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify individuals into different sleep disorder categories.

## Dataset

The project uses the Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset, which includes the following features:
- Gender (Male/Female)
- Age (years)
- Sleep Duration (hours)
- Quality of Sleep (1-10)
- Physical Activity Level (minutes/day)
- Stress Level (1-10)
- BMI Category (Underweight, Normal, Overweight)
- Blood Pressure (systolic/diastolic)
- Heart Rate (bpm)
- Daily Steps
- Sleep Disorder (None, Insomnia, Sleep Apnea)

## Project Structure

- `sleep-disorder-predictor.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the complete analysis and model
- `Sleep_health_and_lifestyle_dataset.csv`: Dataset file
- `README.md`: This file

## Requirements

To run this project, you'll need the following Python packages: # sleep-disorder-classifier
